    # It is useful to switch on some form of memory checking for the tests.
    # Here are some options, commented out.

    # 1) Use Valgrind, which then must be installed on the computer.
    # This uses Valgrind's MemCheck tool.
#      <testing.launcher>"valgrind --leak-check=full --error-exitcode=1"

    # 2) Switch on Address Sanitizer.
    # It is available in LLVM from version 3.1.
#      <toolset>clang:<cxxflags>-fsanitize=address
#      <toolset>clang:<linkflags>-fsanitize=address
    # It is available in GCC from version 4.8.
#      <toolset>gcc:<cxxflags>-fsanitize=address
#      <toolset>gcc:<linkflags>-fsanitize=address
