# Test configuration defines.

# This works in a similar way to the tests for Boost.Config.
# There are two types of tests: pass-* and fail-*.
# If a configuration flag *_NO_[feature] is set, i.e. the feature is not
# available:
# - pass-config-no-[feature] will not do anything, and therefore pass.
# - fail-config-no-[feature] will test the feature, and presumably fail.
# If the configuration flag is not set, i.e. the feature is available:
# - pass-config-no-[feature] will test the feature, and presumably succeed.
# - fail-config-no-[feature] will fail with #error, and therefore fail.

# If a configuration flag is therefore wrongly defined or wrongly not defined,
# this will result in an error.
